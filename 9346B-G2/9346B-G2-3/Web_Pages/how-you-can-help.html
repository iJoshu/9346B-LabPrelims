	<h1 id="title2"><center>RAISING AWARENESS ABOUT CRUELTY TO ANIMALS</center></h1>
	<p class="adjust"> You love your pet with all your heart, but, sadly, there are
	people who aren’t as kind when it comes to animals. Animal abuse is a sadly 
	overlooked issue that can affect not only pets, but livestock, racehorses, 
	circus animals, and the poor animals used in laboratories. If you want to bring 
	attention to this cause, you can choose to do so in many different ways. Here are
	just a few things you can do to raise awareness about animal cruelty right from your computer..
	</p>
		<ul class="">
			<li><h4>Volunteer at your Local Animal Shelter</h4>

				<p class="examp">Often, when abused animals are taken to a shelter, they are very 
				afraid of people. It can take a lot of time and patience to rehabilitate an abused 
				pet, and many shelters don’t have enough staff to tackle the job. You can volunteer
				 your time so these animals may become rehabilitated and eventually be placed in loving homes.
				</p>
			</li>
			
			<li><h4>Donate Money</h4>
				<p class="examp">If you can’t give your time, consider giving your money to a shelter
				or even a respectable charity organization that works to raise awareness of and prevent animal cruelty.
				</p>
			</li>	
			
			<li><h4>Report Animal Cruelty</h4>
				<p class="examp">If you see animal cruelty happening, don’t just turn a blind eye. 
				Animals can’t speak up for themselves, so you must be their voice. 
				Don’t try to stop the abuse yourself or put yourself at risk,
				but do call the police if you are in doubt about what to do.
				</p>
			</li>
			
			<li><h4>Share your Story</h4>
				<p class="examp">Tell us your personal stories, share photos of animals you've helped.
				</p>
				
			</li>
			
			<li><h4>Tell others about the Cause</h4>
				<p class="examp">Tell your friends and family why you support the cause. 
				Many people aren’t aware of just how serious the problem is, and the more 
				people who are willing to protect the rights of animals, the better.
				</p>
			</li>
			
			<p class="examp">Love your pet, and those pets who have never been loved, 
			by supporting the movement to raise awareness about cruelty to animals.
			</p>
