	<h3 id="q1" name="q1"> What is Animal Cruelty?</h3>
		<p class="adjust"> Animal cruelty can be in many different forms. 
		It includes overt and intentional acts of violence towards animals, 
		but it also includes animal neglect or the failure to provide for
		the welfare of an animal under oneâ€™s control.Some examples of neglect 
		are: starvation, dehydration, poor shelter, parasite infestations, 
		failure to seek veterinary care when an animal is in need of medical
		attention, ventilation, space or in unsanitary conditions, and many more.
		And in some cases neglect is a result of the owner's ignorance. 
		Aditionally, it is important to remember animal cruelty is not 
		restricted to cases involving physical harm. Causing animals 
		psychological harm in the form of distress, torment or terror may 
		also constitute animal cruelty.
		</p>
	
		<p class="adjust"> Here in the Philippines, animal cruelty is still rampant and especially in other countries. 
		Numerous cases against animals have been reported. 
		Countless uploads of people abusing animals have been making the rounds 
		of social network. But only a few have been taken seriously. As a nation,
		we need to raise awareness on animal cruelty, especially in our barangays. Millions of people are 
		supporting and are aware of animal protection, yet some are not. 
		Many people are either uneducated on the issue or choose to disregard	
		the millions of accounts on animal cruelty that happen each day.

	<h3 id="q2" name="q1"> What are the particular examples of cruelty?</h3>
		<p class="adjust"> As you read this, another innocent animal is being abused,
		neglected or forced to fight. The first step to creating positive change 
		for these animals is recognizing the cruelty that threatens them.
		</p>
	
			<ul>
				<li>
					<h4> Animal Hoarding</h4>
						<p class="examp"> Animal hoarding occurs when an individual accomodate more 
						animals that he or she can care for, which usually leads to neglect.
						</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h4>Puppy Mills</h4>
						<p class="examp">According to Google Dictionary, puppy mills is an establishment that breeds puppies for sale, 
						typically on an intensive basis and in conditions regarded as inhumane. Some countries still
						do this, admit it or not Philippines is one of those countries. 
						</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h4>Dog Fighting</h4>
						<p class="examp">Dog fighting is a type of blood fight sport in which dogs are forced to fight for the entertainment
						and/or profit of spectators.
						</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h4>Eating Dog/Cat Meat</h4>
						<p class="examp">Some countries use dog meat in food. Whether it's religious, 
						cultural, or just a long-standing tradition, foods made with dog meat are still 
						served in many countries worldwide. And we can't deny the fact that some individuals
						 here in the Philippines are also eating dog/cat meat.
						</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h4>Abandonment</h4>
						<p class="examp"> Abandonment of animals is a huge problem world wide. 
						Animals who had home but lost it. Animals who had family but then abandoned them.
						</p>
				</li>
				
				<li>
					<h4>Animal Experimentation</h4>
						<p class="examp">Animal Experimentation is not required to advance human 
						medical science in modern society. Because humans respond so differently 
						to other animals, using other animals to test on is unreliable at best, 
						and fatally dangerous at worst, for humans. Cruel beyond words, the torturing
						and sacrificing of animals is what  goes on in hidden laboratories in Research Facilities every day.
